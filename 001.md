# How Does the CSS Cascade Work?

The `CSS cascade` determines how conflicting styles are resolved when multiple rules apply to the same element. It follows a specific order of importance to decide which styles should take precedence.

## Cascade Order (High to Low):

1. **Importance (`!important`)**
    - Overrides all other declarations unless another `!important` is more specific.

2. **Specificity**
    - Based on selector types:
        - Inline styles: `1000`
        - IDs: `0100`
        - Classes/attributes/pseudo-classes: `0010`
        - Elements/pseudo-elements: `0001`

3. **Style Origin**
    - Priority:  
      → Browser default  
      → User styles  
      → Author styles (your CSS)  
      → Inline styles  
      → `!important` (in any of the above)

4. **Source Order**
    - If all else is equal, the **last declared rule** wins.

## Example:

```html
<div id="box" class="blue"></div>
```

```css
div { color: black; }
.blue { color: blue; }
#box { color: red; }
.blue { color: green !important; }
```

**Applied color:** `green` — because `!important` has highest priority.
